# Data Structures in Python

### What it does:

**LinkedListsBasic:**<br/>
It defines a simple linked list data structure and various methods to manipulate it, such as deleting or inserting nodes, and printing the list.<br />

**BinarySearch:**<br/>
It defines two implementations of binary search algorithms used to search for a target element in a sorted list. The first is recursive, and the other is iterative.

**BinaryTrees:**<br/>
It implements a binary search tree data structure along with various functions to manipulate and traverse the tree.

**sort:**<br/>
It contains implementations of various sorting algorithms, like selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, and heap sort.
